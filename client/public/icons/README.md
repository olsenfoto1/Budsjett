# PWA icons

Add your web app icons here with the following exact names so the manifest can find them:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512)

Both should be PNG files. No other changes are needed—once the files are placed here they will automatically be served at `/icons/icon-192.png` and `/icons/icon-512.png` for the manifest and install prompts.
